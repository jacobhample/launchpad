### What is Audius?
Audius is owned and run by an open-source community of artists, fans, and api around the world. Audius gives artists the power to share never-before-heard music and monetize streams directly. With the Audius API, developers can build their own apps on top of Audius, giving them access to unique audio catalogs.
